      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It's the most beautiful moment I have ever lived. In
      that particular moment I did not care about what I am, what I am not. It
      was just there in the moment like my adulting has met innocent childhood,
      suddenly all the impurity vanished, everything was beautiful. Big words
      but truly honest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp &nbsp We were on our way to a waterfall, final destination of our
      trip. Last minute, change of plan and we went kayaking. After we had put
      on our lifejackets, we went swimming in the lake. Refreshing. And then it
      was time for kayaking. The instructor explained everything and we went in.
      We burned our energy by racing to the middle of the lake so we laid down
      on our Kayakis. Out of breath, feets in the deep lake, we relaxed. That's
      when I witnessed the moment which I would remember the rest of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp &nbsp We were surrounded by the hills when clouds begin to fall down
      on us. In a moment, we were in the clouds and the visibility become zero.
      Excited and scared, we begin to shout to know if everyone was ok. Everyone
      was. Then rainfall suprised us. In a cold weather, little water droplets
      were magical, felt so soothing. Describing in words is little difficult
      for a person like me who have very little vocabulary. Our feet in the
      water made us feel light. our burden, failur, disappointments were all
      gone in that moment.
