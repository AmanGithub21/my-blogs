        &nbsp &nbsp And finally the result came. He failed. His eyes couldn’t
        belive what he knew deep in his heart – he can not even get bare
        minimum. He froze and felt that emptiness – dark pitch-black void.
        Nothing mattered there, no past, no future, no friend, no family – just
        his faliure.
      </p>

      <p>
        &nbsp &nbsp I watched him closely that day. He was different person –
        before the result and after it. Before the result, he looked confident,
        ready to face the truth, more like fight the truth but after seeing the
        result, he shattered. It felt like we don’t know who he was or where he
        was. It was a strange persona but still, the personality he had a while
        after that was the most scariest one. I could tell by his face – he was,
        in his mind, justifying the most idiotic and cowardly act that a man
        could do – <i>suicide</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        &nbsp &nbsp I sometimes wonder how could anything matter this much that
        you lose your will to live. Suddenly all those irrational thought you
        grow up opposing, about ending ones life, start to feel like a
        considerable option.
